<!--Exercise 8.4-->

8.4 Find the error in each of the following segments of code. [Note: There may be more than
one error.]

a) 	
For(x = 100, x >= 1, ++x)
    document.writeln(x);

The f in For is uppercase should be lowercase, and the separator should be ; not ,  

b) The following code should print whether integer value is odd or even:
switch (value % 2) {
    case 0:
        document.writeln("Even integer");
    case 1:
        document.writeln("Odd integer");
}

Missing break statements after each case. Without break, the code will fall through to the next case.
The corrected code should include break; after each case.

c) The following code should output the odd integers from 19 to 1:
for (x = 19; x >= 1; x += 2)
    document.writeln(x);

The loop end, since x is never gonna be less than 1, since the update is a increment, 
Change the increment to a decrement. x -= 2


d) The following code should output the even integers from 2 to 100:
counter = 2;
do {
    document.writeln(counter);
    counter += 2;
} While(counter < 100);

The W in While should be lowercase.
